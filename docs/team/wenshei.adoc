== PROJECT: SuperTA

---

== Overview

SuperTA is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants and Professors of NUS School of Computing to manage their tutorials and students. It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to delete an existing Assignment in an existing tutorial group.*
** What it does: allows the user to delete the specified assignment from the specified tutorial group.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes when adding assignments, such as creating the assignment in the wrong tutorial group.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects multiple components, such as Logic and Model, and requires in-depth understanding of these components.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a delete-tutorial-group command which allows the user to delete an existing tutorial group. (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2/main/pull/84[#84])
