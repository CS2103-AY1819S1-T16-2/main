== PROJECT: SuperTA

---

== Overview

SuperTA is a desktop application to handle student records for Teaching Assistants and Professors in the School of Computing. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Tutorial Group and Assignment* commands.
** What it does: The creation of commands to manipulate Tutorial Groups and Assignments, including the creation and viewing of these data structures.
** Justification: This feature is essential in achieiving core functionality. It allows teaching assistants to create Tutorial Groups and Assignments, which is key to keeping track of student performance.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects other commands interacting with these data structures.

* *Major enhancement*: improved *User Interface (UI)*
** What it does: The user interface was very barebones at the start and was not visually appealing. The improvement to the UI makes for a better experience for the user on the whole. The UI was also further improved to display details of tutorial groups, assignments, attendance sessions, as well as students.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added various view commands such as `view-session` and `list-tutorial-groups` which will trigger UI actions.

* *Code contributed*: [RepoSense collated code](https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=caephler)
