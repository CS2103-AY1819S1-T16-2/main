== Overview

SuperTA is a desktop application to handle student records for Teaching Assistants and Professors in the School of Computing. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Tutorial Group and Assignment* commands.
** What it does: The creation of commands to manipulate Tutorial Groups and Assignments, including the creation and viewing of these things.
** Justification: This feature is essential in providing value to our target audience. It allows them to create Tutorial Groups and Assignments, so they can keep track of student performance.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects other commands interacting with these data structures.
