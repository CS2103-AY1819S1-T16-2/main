== Introduction

SuperTA is a desktop app for *Teaching Assistants* and *Professors* of NUS School of Computing to manage their tutorials and students. It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Jump to <<Quick Start>> section to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `superTA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SuperTA client.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all students in the directory
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 id/A0123456Y` : adds a student named `John Doe` to the student directory.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
