== PROJECT: SuperTA

---

== Overview

The *purpose* of this portfolio is to document my *role* in the project and the *contributions* I made in the CS2103T project.

*SuperTA* is a desktop application for *Teaching Assistants* and *Professors* of NUS School of Computing to manage their tutorials and students. It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

My role in this project is to *oversee the documentation* in this project. I ensure that the User Guide and Developer Guide is *updated regularly* whenever changes are made to the application.


== Summary of contributions

* *Minor enhancement*: added a remove student from tutorial group command that allows the user to delete a student from a tutorial group.
