== PROJECT: SuperTA

== Overview

SuperTA is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants and Professors of NUS School of Computing to manage their tutorials and students. It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to write feedback to a student*
** What it does: allows the teaching assistant to create feedback for a student for viewing in the future.
** Justification: This feature improves the usability of the SuperTA client as TAs are better able to craft personalized feedback for students to help with their studies.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it involved modifying various files and required thorough tests to be written.

* *Minor enhancement*: modified the view command that allows the TA to view past feedback given to a student. (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2/main/pull/83[#83])
