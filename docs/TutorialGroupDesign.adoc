The `TutorialGroupMaster`,

* stores all Unique Identifiers (UIDs) of `TutorialGroup`.
* stores all `TutorialGroup` instances that are present in the SuperTA client.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<TutorialGroup>` that can be 'observed'.
* Removes any references to a `Student` instance that has been deleted in all `TutorialGroup` s.
* does not depend on any other component to operate.

[NOTE]
The `TutorialGroupMaster` handles generation of UIDs as well. If a `TutorialGroup` is inserted when some other `TutorialGroup` instance has the same ID, then `TutorialGroupMaster` will automatically generate a unique suffix and use that as the `id` of the inserted `TutorialGroup`.

The `TutorialGroupMaster` is able to handle lookup of `TutorialGroup` by ID quickly because it stores all `id` values in a `Set`. This notion of a master is necessary so we can handle operations such as removing all references to a deleted `Student`.

The `TutorialGroup` model,

* has a list of `Student` s that belong to it.
* has a list of `Assignment` s that belong to it.
* should only contain `Student` s that are in the main client.

[NOTE]
The `TutorialGroup` model houses all other object instances that are crucial to the operation of the client. This is done because it makes logical sense - `Student` s and `Assignment` s should belong to a `TutorialGroup` .
